For the past couple of months I have been working on tools which allow you
to run linters on the added/modified lines of a Git diff. One of these tools are
=magit-diff-flycheck=.

This is primarily meant to be used on legacy projects where you do not want to
see errors for the whole file but only for the added/modified lines.

The package is published on [[https://melpa.org/#/magit-diff-flycheck][MELPA]] package manager and on [[https://github.com/ragone/magit-diff-flycheck][GitHub]] under license GNU GPL-3.0.

* Examples

Run =M-x magit-diff-flycheck= in a magit-diff buffer to display a filtered list
of [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck][Flycheck]] errors for the added/modified lines only.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Run Flycheck on added/modified lines by default
M-x magit-diff-flycheck
#+END_SRC

Use can also run the command with a prefix which will prompt you for the scope
of the errors.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Choose scope of error filtering to symbol files or lines
C-u M-x magit-diff-flycheck
#+END_SRC
